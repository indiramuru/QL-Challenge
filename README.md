# QL-Challenge-1
I have referenced 'https://github.com/harrytruong/qchal.git' to come up with a solution to this rock-paper-scissor challenge.
Slightly modified the above original version for the better understanding
**********************************************************************************
Challenge #1: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Summary: Build a website which allows two people to play rock-paper-scissors over the internet. It doesnâ€™t need to allow more than one simultaneous game and you may assume that Player 1 enters the game from /player1 and Player 2 enters the game from /player2. Please implement your solution in Meteor.

Deliverables: A link to a Github repo with the source of your project. Thorough commenting of the code isn't necessary, but you will have to explain it in detail to us.
